		We know what it's like: oily or dry skin, incessant rashes, and relentless break outs. 
		Thus, we understand the frustration that comes with these imperfections.  
		However, this does not mean that you should give up. 
		clean and healthy skin should not be a far-fetched dream; 
		It should be a daily accomplishment, and if you need help getting there, we are here for you!
		<br><br>
		Our goal is to improve the health of everyone in the freshest and most natural means possible. 
		This means no toxic chemicals, no harsh corrosives, and no foreign names in our arsonal of ingredients. 
		With our philosophy rooted in using only what is natural, we hope you feel a comforting sense of relief, 
		knowing that we are 100% committed to your well-being. Every bar of soap comes from tireless hours and 
		unwavering efforts in order to help you progress towards a healthier "you". 
		After all, <em>health is a gift that deserves to be protected!</em><br><br>

		One generic bar of soap cannot possibly cater to the plethora of skin types out there 
		(in fact, it might actually create more problems). 
		That is why we sell more than one kind of soap. We do not create just for aesthetics; there is a deeper purpose.
		<br><br>
		We love what we do and we are proud of what we make. 
		The products that we sell are the very same ones we use everyday.
		In adopting a "back to the basics" movement, we champion the elegant simplicity of handmade 
		artisan craft that is created with the well-being of others in mind. 
		Everything is natural, everything is fresh. That is our Homeroot Creations promise to you.<br><br>
