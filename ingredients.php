				<div id="intro-desc">Our crafts are comprised of these: ingredients designed to improve the skin, for every type of skin. Whether it's dry skin or oily, tough skin or delicate, we've thought of you already! We employ only the finest ingredients, aiming to be the freshest and most natural, because that is what artisan soapmaking is all about. Now let these ingredients speak for us to tell you that we genuinely care about your well-being!<br><br>
				We have split all our ingredients into 9 categories ranging from oils to clay. The purpose of this is for you to know what we put in our craft and why we do so. Why the transparency? <br><br>Because <em>you deserve to know what you put in your body.</em>

						<div class="ing-grid-title">Oils 
						</div>
							To illlustrate our dedication to your health, we select only the finest oils that will touch your skin. Among the shelves stocked to the brim with oils, we have selected a few to illustrate our commitment to your well-being. 
							<br><br>
							First to be featured is Olive Oil! Due to the high content of oleic acid, this oil has hypotensive properties that help lower blood pressure. Moreoever, it is also an anti-inflammatory and is good for skin cell regeneration. 
							<br><br>
							Got dry, sensitive skin? Rice Bran Oil is the answer! It is rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins, and essential oils. But more importantly, it is a mild oil perfect for skin that needs a more delicate touch.
							<br><br>
							Last but not least is Coconut Oil. It provides fast-acting benefits since it is so quickly absorbed, widely known to be an antioxidant. However, it's benefits do not stop there; it also works as an antiinflamatory and interestingly, also relieves itching!
							<br><br>

					<div class="ing-grid-text">
						<div class="ing-grid-title">Butters 
						</div>
							The importance of this category cannot be overstated; it plays a key role in providing the moisturization that every generic lotion claims but in a way that is organic and all-natural. Below are several popular butters that we use to provide you with an unparalleled sense of rejuvination.
							<br><br>
							Mango butter is commonly known to be three things: an antioxidant, an antifungal , and an anti-inflammatory. If this were not enough to convince you of its goodness, it also has excellent moisturizing properties. 
							<br><br>
							Shea butter is dry skin's best friend. It immediately melts at skin temperature, providing great moisturizing properties, vitamins, and also minerals.

						<div class="ing-grid-title">Additives 
						</div>
							The word "additives" has such a negative connotation. For example, "many foods contain chemical additives." We're here to tell you that the additives we put in our craft are nothing but good!
							<br><br>
							Goat Milk Powder a common additive we use for our Goat Milk Soap. If you have not tried it yet, then let us tell you that it has superb moisturizing properties. Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, it treats your skin right with all the nourishments it needs. Because of that, goat milk is readily absorbed by the skin, hungry for more.
							<br><br>
							Oatmeal is another common additive that we use for its moisturizing capabilities. Interestingly, it can also alleviate itchiness. 
							<br><br>
							Have you ever heard of apricot seed powder? How about pumice stones then? Apricot seed powder as well as pumice both have great exfoliating properties, removing dead skin and creating an opening for new skin to come in!

				<div class = "for" id = "3-text">
					<div class="ing-grid-text">
						<div class="ing-grid-title">Clay
						</div>
							Clay, specifically, Kaolin clay, is generally used as a skin detoxifying + cleaning agent. However, what makes it so unique is that it is very mild; that means it is perfect for sensitive skin! But how else does it purify and refresh your skin? Firstly, Kaolin clay is high in silica that helps remove the dead skin and regenerate new skin. Secondly, itâ€™s unique properties help stimulate circulation to the skin. 
							<br><br>
							Sea Clay is just as useful as a detoxifying agent, being able to draw oil and toxins from the skin. Moreover, it also has a high content of minerals, which can help revitalize skin with much needed nutrients.
							<br><br>
							The last clay to be featured is one that has been used among soapmakers for centuries: it is Rhassoul Clay and its beneficial properties speak for its prevalence in skincare. Most curiously, the clay extracts impurities from you skin and replaces it with an abundance of minerals. That is how it enhances skin texture, reduces dryness, and improves skin elasticity.

					<div class="ing-grid-text">
						<div class="ing-grid-title">Colorants
						</div>
							Of course we have to color our soaps to make them pretty! There are three main categories of colorants that we use and they are: natural colorants, ultramarines + oxides, and micas.  
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class = "for" id = "5-text">
					<div class="ing-grid-text">
						<div class="ing-grid-title">Fragrance
						</div>
							Fragrances breaks down into two categories: Essential oils and fragrance oils. Both are used to give our crafts a unique and captivating smell, however, only essential oils are derived from nature. Although we do employ both essential and fragrance oils, we use only the highest of quality. 
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class = "for" id = "6-text">
					<div class="ing-grid-text">
						<div class="ing-grid-title">Sea Salt + Sugar
						</div>
							What can sugar do for the skin?<br> 1: it attracts moisture from the environment into the skin. <br>2: it encourages skin to rejuvinate. <br>3: it exfoliates dead skin, allowing new skin to grow.
							<br><br>
							What about bath salts? Bath salts contain minerals and nutrients that keep our skin smooth and soft. When dissolved in warm water (hot bath, anyone?), the minerals in the salt are able to extract impurities from your open pores. 
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class = "for" id = "7-text">
					<div class="ing-grid-text">
						<div class="ing-grid-title">Vitamin E
						</div>
							Free radicals are toxic compounds that are missing a single electron in their outer shell and thus are desperate to fill it. Because of this, free radicals may steal electrons from your body's cell structure, and a whole chain reaction can occur that leads to health damage. In short, free radicals are bad, and on top of that, Vitamin E, one of the most powerful antioxidants in the world, cannot be produced by the human body. 
							<br><br>
							Thus it is imperative that we get our Vitamin E through fruits, veggies, or our soap! When applied to the skin, Vitamin E neutralizes free radicals in the skin and prevents signs of aging. That, on top of the ability to improve skin hydration, makes Vitamin E the hero of the day!

					<div class="ing-grid-text">
						<div class="ing-grid-title">Exotic Oils
						</div>
							What's the difference between regular oils and exotic oils? It's rarity. But there is no expense saved in providing you with only the best crafts.
							<br><br>
							Rich in antioxidants, natural vitamin E, and essential fatty acids, Argan Oil is a must-have ingredient in any health-conscious product. It's extraordinary benefits can be used to heal wounded skin, maintain elasticity, and even turn back time on wrinkles.
							<br><br>
							Rosehip oil also falls into the same category of "exotic oil." Like everything else we've listed, it comes with some great properties! In this oil exist tannins that causes skin to tighten and leave it with a non-greasy touch. If that alone were not enough, it offers antioxidant and light-protective properties. Just a little Rosehip Oil can help with UV damaged skin, fine lines, and wrinkles!
